**What is NYC Planning Labs?**

NYC Planning Labs is a new tech services unit in the NYC Department of City Planning.  We are passionate about applying modern technology best practices to Urban Planning problems, and will deliver lightweight, open, and impactful tools to support the agency.  We're founded on the idea that government can build digital services better/faster/cheaper in-house, and achieve better outcomes by openly sharing code and knowledge.

**What Kinds of Things Will Labs Build?**

We are focusing on small projects that can go from concept to shipped in 4 to 6 weeks, with our customers being the internal divisions of the agency. These can be web map explorers similar to the [NYC Facilities Explorer](https://capitalplanning.nyc.gov/facilities/explorer), interactive data visualizations and animations, or simple purpose-built data tools that replace or complement our Planners' routine workflows.  

**How We Build is as Important as What We Build**

Our Team's mission is two-fold:

1. To design and build modern, lightweight, sustainable, and impactful technology products that support the mission of the Department of City Planning

2. To implement and promote the use of agile methods, human-centered design, and open technology to support the above, maximizing the benefits of community-driven product development

When it comes to government technology, we believe that *how* we build is as important as *what* we build, and participation in the civic technology and open source software communities is a force multiplier for small teams.  An explicit part of our mission is to talk about what we build while we build it.  We'll be documenting our design sessions, assumptions, and user feedback.  We'll tweet about tech challenges, in search of developers who may have experienced similar issues. We'll blog about lessons learned, experiments, successes, failures, and *what just works*. We'll be *open by default*, and put our code, data, and resources online whenever possible so others can tinker, test, and contribute.  

**Let's do this!**

We are very excited to get started, and will spend the coming weeks staffing up and working with DCP's leadership to define our project pipeline. Check back soon for updates!
