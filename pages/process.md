## Step 1: Idea Submission
###### Customer
DCP staff submit a clearly defined problem that needs solving, such as a real-world planning issue, a minor technical workflow, or something in between.

<a class="usa-button usa-button-marginless" href="#">Submit an idea</a>

## Step 2: Idea Vetting
###### Labs + Customer
When an idea is submitted, the Planning Labs team starts a dialogue with the customer to determine if it's a good candidate for a Labs project.  

- Subject matter and data can be openly discussed
- Minimum viable product is achievable in 4 to 6 weeks
- Technical fit for the skillset of the Planning Labs team

## Step 3: Idea Listing
###### Public
Vetted ideas enter a public listing where stakeholders can promote their idea through open discussion. Although the ideas in this list may be a good fit, they're not Labs projects yet.

## Step 4: Project Selection
###### Executive Office + Labs
Each time the Planning Labs team completes a project, the Chief Operating Officer selects a new project from the ideas list.

## Step 5: Pipeline Posting
###### Public
When a new project is selected, it's added to the pipeline on our website, which contains three projects&mdash;our currently active project, and the next two on deck.
